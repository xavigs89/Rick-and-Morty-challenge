# React Frontend Technical Test

Using React and the following public API https://rickandmortyapi.com/ , complete the following exercises:

1. Call API and show the Rick and Morty's characters.
2. Be able to edit characters, by opening an edit form with the parameters name, location, and status. Keep the new data mocked, as we cannot do PUT in API.
3. Create a table, with a list of the 10 first characters (only main data, not images).
4. Extend the current functionality to include pagination. Allow the user to navigate through different pages of characters.
5. Implement a search bar to filter characters by name.
6. Add filtering options to the characters list.
